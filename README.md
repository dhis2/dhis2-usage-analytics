This repo contains the usage analytics app. Which was rewritten from scratch and introduced in DHIS2 version 2.32. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Developer guide

### Prerequisites

To use the usage-analytics-app in development mode, it is necessary to have a running DHIS2 instance, and be logged in to it. Most developers use their local DHIS2 instance.

### Deploy

#### Local deployment

In order to test the build of the usage-analytics-app (rather than just the dev server), deploy it to your local dhis2 build. The instructions here assume a good understanding of building DHIS2 locally.

From the root of the usage-analytics-app, build the usage-analytics-app locally

```
yarn build
```

Then run the command below to install the built project to the `/repository/org/hisp/dhis/dhis-app-usage-analytics` folder of your .m2 directory:

```
mvn install
```

Navigate to your local dhis2 repo, `/dhis-2/dhis-web` directory. Then run the command below to build a `dhis.war` file under `dhis-web/dhis-web-portal/target`

```
mvn clean install -o
```

Finally, paste the built `dhis.war` file into your Tomcat `/webapps` directory

#### Deploy to production

Every commit to master and version branches (i.e. v30, v31, etc.) is automatically deployed.
